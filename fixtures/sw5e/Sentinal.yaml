summary: |
  The sentinel uses stealth and subterfuge to accomplish the will of the Force. 
  Where the consular focuses on mastery of the Force and the guardian focuses 
  on the mastery of the lightsaber, the sentinel focuses on merging the two.
description: |
  Clad in black robes, the rattataki pulls his hood forward and steps into the 
  shadowy alcove, only to reappear further down the hall. As his quarry walks 
  past, he presses the hilt of his lightsaber to the back of their head, 
  quickly toggling it on-and-off. He is gone before the corpse hits the ground.
  
  The togruta dashes across the battlefield, doublesaber deflecting blaster 
  shots to the ground. She pulls her wounded padawan to her feet, and 
  guides her away from the warzone.
  
  Green-bladed lightsaber a blur, the cathar ferociously presses the 
  attack. With each strike, she guides her opponent closer to the ravineâ€™s 
  edge. A flurry of blows followed by a quick force push and her foe tumbles 
  over the edge.

  Sentinels are the masters of blending force powers with weapon attacks. They 
  weave the two together so expertly that their foes have trouble predicting them.
